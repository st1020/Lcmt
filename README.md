# lcmt
A Linux Container Manager On Termux

This is just a project to practice my python skill.
In fact, this is my first python program. It can help you manage Linux Container on Termux.
You can type'''lcmt --help'''to see the usage.
By the way, it only have Chinese prompt now. Because I'm too lazy to add English translation.
And it just have 500+ lines of code, I think anyone who learned python can read it easily.
